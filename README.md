jedit-schemes
=============
These are just some jedit schemes that have been collected from various sources by me over time. I claim no ownership for these. From time to time I will pick a favorite theme and edit it to something I like. This is a good easy way to track changes and have access to all the schemes on multiple machines.

I do not intend to violate any licenses and if I'm doing so, I would gladly fix any issue that might exist if you just bring it to my attention.
